# Style guide
#### Jesse Emmelot <br> 11963522

- For JavaScript, use camelCase
- For Python, use snake_case
- For HTML, use kebab-case
- Use tabs for indentation
- In Javascript, put every .attr/.value.text etc. on a newline (all on the same one tab indentation below the main instance)  
- In Javascript, normal functions have a newline after the first { and before the last }. Local functions do not necessarily have these, only if the function is too long.
- Define the language and charset to be used where necessary
- Use multiline comments before large functions, as well as at the top of files
- Link all code/data sources in the multiline comment at the top of files
- Write everything in English (including comments and Markdown files)
