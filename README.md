## Summary
This visualization will be made to inform people who are interested in personal solar energy about the potential energy gains and financial gains. It will offer charts to show relevant data of their local weather station as well as results for potential gains, based on their own input values.

## Problem statement
With climate being an important reoccurring topic of news and discussion, it is often stated that the individual can contribute in a positive way. One of the ways is personal solar energy, and although solar panels on regular houses are a common sight, it may not be clear to everyone what the benefits for them could be. This project targets every home owner with interest in personal solar power.
