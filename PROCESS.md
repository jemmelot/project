Monday <br> 8-1 | First sketch made, Proposal made. <br> Design decisions (ideas): <br> - interactive charts: one in which data for one particular weather station is shown (line/bar chart) and one in which this weatherstation is compared to others (bar chart). <br> - color coded map of the Netherlands, in which all municipalities are present (bases on their distance to the closest weather station. <br> - textboxes in which users can enter details about their house for calculation purposes. 
Tuesday <br> 9-1 | Made several sketches to highlight every feature of the first main sketch, eventually made a new main design sketch based on feedback, with changed or improved features. <br> Design decisions (ideas): <br> - Put more focus on the house features of the user, less on how weather stations compare to eachother. This is more interesting for the user. <br> - Only one line/bar chart, in which monthly/annual data for one particular weather station are shown, as well as how much enery can be produced in a single day or month in the area where the users house stands, bases on the features of the house. <br> - Addition of a radar plot to show how well every house feature scores. <br> - Addition of radial progress bars to show how much potential a particular month has compares to the most sufficient month of the year for solar energy. 
Wednesday <br> 10-1 | Improved sketch with more details (with practical and technical functionality of every asset explained in seperate images). Made design document. <br> Design decisions (ideas): <br> - Add tooltips where these could clarify data and results. <br> - Dropdown menus for all house variables selection for the sake of user friendliness, as well as to prevent misuse (like entering negative of overly large values) and make a more consice scoring system for the radar plot.
Thrusday <br> 11-1 | First stand-up, feedback gotten and discussed new options, prepared datasets, made prototype. <br> Design decisions (ideas): <br>- radial progress bar: shows one global score of a particular house (based on the averages of the scores of each of its attributes), addition of interactivity (tooltip on hover) <br> - radarplot: &#39;ghost&#39; plot: how would changes to the attributes of a house influence the results on the plot? USer can switch between the highlighting of either radar plots.
Friday <br> 12-1 | First presentation, feedback gotten: <br> - choose between either a line chart or a bar chart, instead of both <br> - checkboxes instead of radio buttons in the charts (as to be able to show grouped lines/bars) <br> - possible later addition of Google Maps API to pick a location more specifically.
Monday <br> 15-1 | Removed insufficient/unnecessary data from datasetss. Added dataset 'percentages' to be able to get the efficiency of a solar panel at every roof angle/orientation combination. Wrote required functions to be able to use all user inputs from the dropdown menus in Javascript and update variable value. Implemented most functions to determine the results (energy production, profit, investment payback period). By doing all of the required maths first, it will be certain that the visualizations will show relevant data from the start
Tuesday <br> 16-1 | Implemented nearly all formulas, with results that are displayed on screen and update with every changed input. User friendliness has been improved by being able to select a weather station on the dotted map. These and other inputs are now also shown in their textbox when they are picked from their own dropdown menus. Also added a placeholder slider in which months/years will be selectable to specify which months from the KNMI datasets are to be obtained for data.
Wednesday <br> 17-1 | Added functionality to the slider, so that it console logs data from the selected weather station at the currently selected month. Added the basis for the line chart.
Thursday <br> 18-1 | Made an alpha version, containing most of assets for the visualizations to be shown in. The map is interactive and allows users to change location by clicking on any of the dots. Changing the location with the dropdown menu will highlight the corresponding dot on the map. All other user inputs are also working, and are shown inside a their text box for clear usability. The results, though not entirely accurate yet (using placeholder temperature/radiation) do change upon changing several of the dropdown menu options. There is also an early version of the radar plot, which shows a general image of how house details will be ranked (currently based on rough scores). Finally, after picking a location, moving the slider at the bottom will console log the correct data for that weather station during that month (to be used to plot the line chart).
